Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.

**Always ask one question at a time.** For each question, form your own recommendation first, then ask:
- Discrete options → use `AskUserQuestion` tool, recommended option first marked "(Recommended)"
- Open-ended → ask in plain text, but state your recommendation before the question

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

There is no maximum number of questions. Keep going until every branch of the decision tree is resolved — some plans need three questions, some need fifty. If the session feels too long, the user can stop at any time or say "wrap up" to summarise and move on. Natural-language steering is the intended control surface, not a numeric limit.
